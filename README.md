# Discoball 
![DiscoBall](https://github.com/HiboTronix/DiscoBall/blob/master/Images/discoball_complete.jpg)
</p>Here are the DIY files so you can build your own DiscoBall.
There are 3 main parts to DiscoBall, the centre, the alignment caps and the ribs.
These files don't include a portable power solution.  I used a dc-dc converter, a lipo battery and charger that I could fit inside.</p>
<p>An Adafruit Powerboost1000  with a TP4056 lipo charger (with protection) should be ample if you use the standard brightness of 10.</p>
</p>Reference images are in the images folder.</p>
</p>Arduino IDE setup instructions are in the Software folder.</p>
</p>All the parts you require including the Gerbers required to have the PCBs manufactured are above, start by reading the assembly pdf.</p>
</p></p>
</p>I wish you luck and I'd love to see it if you make one, catch me on Twitter(@HiboTronix) and/or tag it with #Discoball : )</p>
